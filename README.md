This is a learning project from the JavaScript course, "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022 From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann. The HTML and CSS code are written by Jonas.
The JS component however, is written from scratch. The JS component contains the following:
<br>-selecting, creating and deleting elements with innerHTML, insertAdjacentHTML
<br>-accessing the styles, attributes and classes of elements
<br>-implementing smooth scrolling
<br>-Event Delegation: bubbling and capturing events
<br>-using Intersection Observer API to implement sticky navigation, lazy loading images
<br>-creating sliding components
